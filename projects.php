              <p>Zonautas is an Spanish blog about <b>technology, gadgets and videogames</b>. Its motto is to offer content that <b>pleases reading</b> above anything else. This might be the project that I appreciate the most, as it was the start of a new era for me.</p>
              <p>It started as a forum but shortly after became the blog that it is today with a wide array of reviews and articles.</p>

              <p>Linux22 is a learning platform that offers virtual private servers to promote the use of IPv6, GNU/Linux and FLOSS software altogether. It strives to be a collaborative project with an outstanding community that looks after each other.</p>
              <p>Since its inception back in 2017, it has grown from two servers to five that are solely used by their users.</p>
              <p>This will be phased out to a new brand that will offer an ever better service in the near future.</p>
