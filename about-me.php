              <p class="card-text">Howdy stranger and welcome to my page! I am a student from Spain who loves everything that it's related to technology. And this spectrum is huge: I love being a <b>sysadmin</b>, I find both <b>cryptography and cybersecurity</b> as some interesting areas to explore and I spend part of my free time <b>playing videogames</b>.</p>
              <p>You will rarely find me programming because it's not something I am into. <i>(Well, that varies between seasons)</i> But if you actually do, I must say that it will always be free, libre and open source software. This is the software that keeps the world running and, you know, sharing is caring. &#128150;</p>
              <p>Something you're more likely to see me doing is taking apart things: I always get an urge to see what's hiding inside. :-)</p>
              <p>Related to that, I own several original iPods and I mod them by replacing their hard disks or batteries. I find amusing that these "tiny" devices had hard drives inside them. My current daily driver is an <b>iPod Video 80GB (aka 5.5th gen)</b>. It plays Shrek.
              <p>I am not very "social" when it comes to social networks. I have an account in most of them (namely, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram...) but I don't use them at all. The only one that I actively use is Mastodon. <span style="color: #bfbfbf;">If you want to follow me (and trust me, you don't) you will have to find me. It is not that difficult.</span></p>
              <p>This website was created in a rush of creativity back in 26th March 2020, and I am impressed with the result. Oh, and I must thank to everyone who served me of inspiration while I was creating this website:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://maki.cat/" target="_blank">Maki.cat</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://qorg11.net/" target="_blank">qorg11</a> (guestbook, lainfag)</li>
                <li><a href="http://posweg.es/" target="_blank">Pòsweg</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>And I think that's all I had to say for now. Congrats if you made it up to here. Oh, and I love IPv6.</p>
              <p>Today I feel like having some <b>Ravioli</b>.</p>
